oss:
    title: OSS Contributions
    intro: >
      I don't have a one project to focus contribution on. 
      The whole my OSS participating time (from around 2001) I post patches, pull requests, create wikis whenever it is useful.
      I'm the kind of person that tries not to reinvent the wheel when a lot of the wheels was already done.
      So I enjoy learning and enhancing/contributing an existing OSS.

    title: OSS technologies
    intro: >
      20+ years of experience with Linux, kernel configuration, patching, Grub, u-boot, buildroot (and similar).
      I'm actively using Void Linux, Gentoo Linux, OpenWRT.
      I have also knowledge of FreeBSD (all my servers runs that for around a decade), I have created a port of FreeBSD to NanoPI NEO3.
      I have a long term experience with ZFS on Linux (only as a user, because of my work conflict of interest), boot enviroments, snapshot management, replications, etc.
      Since working in a debugers team I'm also able to use GDB (but have much more experience with Solaris MDB) and I'm aware of the modern Linux tracing possibilities (regularly use bpftrace).
