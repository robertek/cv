oss:
    title: OSS Contributions
    intro: >
      I don't have a one project to focus contribution on. 
      The whole my OSS participating time (from around 2001) I post patches, pull requests, create wikis whenever it is useful.
      I'm the kind of person that tries not to reinvent the wheel when a lot of the wheels was already done.
      So I enjoy learning and enhancing/contributing an existing OSS.
